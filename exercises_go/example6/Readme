Example 6 - Refactor code to use modularization

This simple CLI requests input for a file that's contents match a specific format structure:

{
    "title": "Workshop Title",
    "instructors": [
        {
            "name": "Instructor 1",
            "email": "instructor1@example.com"
        },
        {
            "name": "Instructor 2",
            "email": "instructor2@example.com"
        }
    ]
}

If the input file validates against this structure then the data is converted to YAML format and then printed out, otherwise the application will exit 1.
